    (CACS 1 (Ch.1)) | QID: 4679224483 | 2023-09-07 
   <br>
   <br> Question: John is a Covered Person (CP) working for ABC Bank in Singapore. The HR department of ABC discovers that John was once censured by his previous employer PQR Private Limited for indiscipline. PQR is a private company selling branded computers. John was the Finance Manager of the company. John was also recently ordered by a Singapore court to repay a S$20,000 loan he had taken from his friend Jane. The dispute was settled when John repaid the full amount as per the judgement. John had not disclosed these incidents to ABC at the time of his interview or appointment. John: 
   <p>A) does not satisfy the fit and proper criteria of financial soundness because he was ordered to repay a debt.</p> 
   <p>B) does not satisfy the fit and proper criteria for honesty, integrity and reputation because he has been censured for indiscipline.</p> 
   <p style="color: green">C) satisfies the fit and proper criteria for financial soundness because he has repaid the debt.</p> 
   <p style="color: green">D) has not violated the fit and proper criteria for honesty, integrity and reputation because the censure was not passed by a government or a professional body.</p> Answer: CD 
   <br>
   <br> Explanation: 
   <br>
   <br> (Chapter 1.5) There is no outstanding judgement debt against John because he repaid the debt. The censure by a private company may not be considered a violation of the fit and proper criteria for honesty, integrity and reputation.

   <br> Tip: If you are weak in English, you'll need more practice on reading English questions. You should use the translation to validate your original understanding of the question, as well as to better understand the explanation for this question. Furthermore, the quality of the translation may vary, so it is not recommended to over rely on translation.
